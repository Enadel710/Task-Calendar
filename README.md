# Task-Calendar
This is a personal project that I've created to help organize tasks into a list. It is called a task calendar, and it allows the user to create tasks they need to complete, and when they need to complete them by.

As of the current version, this program only handles the input and temporary storage of the user's tasks.

TO DO:
- Let the program accept more specific priority options.
  - Potentially remove the enum type and instead have the user signify the exact time they need to complete each task by.
- Store the user's task list in a file so the information will not be lost on each run.
- Convert the program to an applet or separate executable.
